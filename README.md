1.  **Kebab-case (`lower-case-with-dashes`):** This is the most widely accepted standard for repository names (and URLs) in the open-source community.
    *   It is URL-friendly: `github.com/user/pacmann-data-science` reads perfectly.
    *   It avoids capitalization issues across different operating systems (Windows is case-insensitive, Linux is case-sensitive).
2.  **Descriptive:** It clearly states the organization/context ("Pacmann") and the topic ("Data Science") without being cryptic.

*   ✅ `pacmann-data-science`
